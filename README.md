# churn_prediction_streamlit

This repo contains a random forrest classifier that was trained to predict customer churns based on [this kaggle dataset by Telco](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mechatronixs/telco-churn-prediction-feature-engineering-eda/data). It is a learning project to become familiar with deploying a model on streamlit.
